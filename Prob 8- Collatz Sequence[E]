C++ Code with explanation:-

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;  // this value is given to us
    cout<<n<<" "; // as first term always equal to n 
    while(n!=1){
        if(n%2==0){    
            cout<<n/2<<" ";
            n=n/2;// as in Collatz Sequence if n is even it will updated to n/2 
        }
        else{
            cout<<(3*n+1)<< " "; 
            n=3*n+1;// and if it is odd then updated to 3*n+1
        }
    }
  return 0;
}
