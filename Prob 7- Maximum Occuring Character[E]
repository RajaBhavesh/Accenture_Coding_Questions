C++ Code

        int arr[27]={0};   // we have initialised an array of size 27 (you can also make it to 26) that is used to store the frequency of character 
        for(int i=0;i<str.size();i++){

        int maxi=INT_MIN;            //and its index denote a pattern liks 1-> for a
        for(int i=0;i<27;i++){       // -> for b etc.
            maxi=max(maxi,arr[i]);

        }                            // then we have checked the smallest lexigrophical character that have same no. of freqency that of max value and we have stored that index
        char ch=ans-1+'a';            // then according to the index we have mapped it to respectice character and at last we returned it;
